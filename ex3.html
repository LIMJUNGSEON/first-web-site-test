<br><span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span></span> (or "JS") is a programming language used to dynamically handle web pages on the client side, 
<br>but it is often used on the server side using a runtime such as <span>Node.js</span>
<br><span class="js">JavaScript</span> should not be confused with the Java programming language. "Java" and "<span class="js">JavaScript</span>" are trademarks 
<br>(or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the United States and other countries, but the two programming languages differ significantly
<br>in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.
<br>Most often, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is used in browsers. Developers can manipulate the content of web pages through the DOM and handle 
<br>the data with <span>AJAX</span> and IndexedDB. You can draw with canvas and interact with devices running browsers using various APIs. 
<br>With the improvement and growth of browser APIs, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> has become one of the most spoken languages in the world.
